Notes:

The two output differ in the color and general style. That has happened because we have included the sasweb style in the second pdf. Now we can see that headings, headers inside table are colored blue. The other difference is that the page number 3 in OutputA is not present in OutputB. It is titled "Descriptor Portion of All Data Sets in Work Library". The reason being, to ensure that the output is being displayed in the web environment, SAS Studio uses specific ODS options. If output of the code is not compatible with a Web environment, that code is not displayed.
